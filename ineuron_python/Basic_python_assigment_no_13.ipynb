        "\n",
        "ANS: In CSV, the user writes the column headers only once. While importing the data, excel consumes much of the memory. While importing the data, csv consumes less of memory and it can be much faster.\n",

        "Q2: 2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: First, call open() and pass it 'w' to open a file in write mode . This will create the object can then pass to csv. writer() to create a Writer object. On Windows,also need to pass a blank string for the open() function's newline keyword argument.\n",

        "Q5: What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: The delimiter is the character that appears between cells on a row. By default, the delimiter for a CSV file is a comma. The line terminator is the character that comes at the end of a row. By default, the line terminator is a newline.\n",
