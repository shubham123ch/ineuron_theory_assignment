        "\n",
        "ANS: Regular expressions are particularly useful for defining filters. Regular expressions contain a series of characters that define a pattern of text to be matched—to make a filter more specialized, or general.\n",
        "\n",
        "regular expressions for searching data based on a particular pattern. You can leverage regular expressions to find and replace text, validate data, and more. They can also make your code crisp, readable and easier to manage and maintain.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS: compile(pattern, repl, string): We can combine a regular expression pattern into pattern objects, which can be used for pattern matching. It also helps to search a pattern again without rewriting it.\n",
        "\n",
        "compile() method is used to compile a regular expression pattern provided as a string into a regex pattern object ( re. Pattern ). Later we can use this pattern object to search for a match inside different target strings using regex methods such as a re.\n",

Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but re.match() searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none. \n",
        "While re.search() searches for the whole string even if the string contains multi-lines and tries to find a match of the substring in all the lines of string."
