        "ANS: Text files are organized around lines, each of which ends with a newline character ('\\n'). The source code files are themselves text files. A binary file is the one in which data is stored in the file in the same way as it is stored in the main memory for processing.\n",

        "ANS: Text files are used to store data more user friendly. Binary files are used to store data more compactly. In the text file, a special character whose ASCII value is 26 inserted after the last character to mark the end of file. In the binary file no such character is present.\n",
        "\n",
        "The text files can easily be transferred from one computer system to another. Binary files cannot easily be transferred from one computer system to another due to variations in the internal variations in the internal representation which varies from computer to computer.\n",

        "Q4: Describe a benefit of using the with keyword instead of explicitly opening a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: The advantage of using a with statement is that it is guaranteed to close the file no matter how the nested block exits. If an exception occurs before the end of the block, it will close the file before the exception is caught by an outer exception handler.Using with means that the file will be closed as soon as you leave the block. This is beneficial because closing a file is something that can easily be forgotten and ties up resources that you no longer need. Note that this isn't specific to Python 3 at all.\n",
