        "ANS: What is a feature explain with an example in ML?\n",
        "In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial element of effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: What are the various circumstances in which feature construction is required?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: most researchers have state that the cost (budget), time, quality and management as the main of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in project success.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: Describe how nominal variables are encoded.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: When we have a feature where variables are just names and there is no order or rank to this variable's feature.For example: City of person lives in, Gender of person, Marital Status, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4: Describe how numeric features are converted to categorical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Discretization: It is the process of transforming continuous variables into categorical variables by creating a set of intervals, which are contiguous, that span over the range of the variable's values. It is also known as “Binning”, where the bin is an analogous name for an interval.\n",

        "approach?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:In wrapper methods, the feature selection process is based on a specific machine learning algorithm that we are trying to fit on a given dataset. It follows a greedy search approach by evaluating all the possible combinations of features against the evaluation criterion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6: When is a feature considered irrelevant? What can be said to quantify it?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: One general definition for relevance is that a feature can be regarded as irrelevant if it is conditionally independent of the class labels or it does not influence the class labels; in these cases, it can be discarded.\n",

        "Q7: When is a function considered redundant? What criteria are used to identify features that could\n",
        "be redundant?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: if two features {X1, X2} are highly correlated, then the two features become redundant features since they have same information in terms of correlation measure. In other words, the correlation measure provides statistical association between any given a pair of features.\n",

        "\n",

        "The most common distance function used for numeric attributes or features is the Euclidean distance which is defined in the following formula: Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q9: State difference between Euclidean and Manhattan distances?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS: Euclidean distance is the shortest path between source and destination which is a straight line but Manhattan distance is sum of all the real distances between source(s) and destination(d) and each distance are always the straight lines.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS: 1.SVD, or Singular Value Decomposition, is one of several techniques that can be used to reduce the dimensionality, i.e., the number of columns, of a data set. Why would we want to reduce the number of dimensions? In predictive analytics, more columns normally means more time required to build models and score data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.A hybrid feature selection method is proposed for classification in small sample size data sets. • The filter step is based on instance learning taking advantage of the small sample size of data. • A few candidate feature subsets are generated since their number corresponds to the number of instances.\n",
