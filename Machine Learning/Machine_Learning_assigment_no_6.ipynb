        "ANS: A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. we train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS: The “no free lunch” (NFL) theorem for supervised machine learning is a theorem that essentially implies that no single machine learning algorithm is universally the best-performing algorithm for all problems.\n",

        "Q3: Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS:K-fold Cross-Validation is when the dataset is split into a K number of folds and is used to evaluate the model's ability when given new data. K refers to the number of groups the data sample is split into. For example, if you see that the k-value is 5, we can call this a 5-fold cross-validation.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS: The bootstrap method is a statistical technique for estimating quantities about a population by averaging estimates from multiple small data samples. Importantly, samples are constructed by drawing observations from a large data sample one at a time and returning them to the data sample after they have been chosen.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS: Ensemble modeling is a process where multiple diverse models are created to predict an outcome, either by using many different modeling algorithms or using different training data sets. The ensemble model then aggregates the prediction of each base model and results in once final prediction for the unseen data.\n",

A geometric model or spatial model is a descriptive model that represents geometric and/or spatial relationships.\n",
