This is the main issue with symmetry and reason why you should initialize weights randomly (or, at least, with different values). Note, that this issue affects all architectures that use each-to-each connections.\n",

        "-simplicity of the ReLU activation function makes it many people’s preferred option, despite the fact that it is generally outperformed by SELU and leaky ReLU. However, the ReLU activation function’s ability to output precisely zero can be useful in some cases (e.g., see Chapter 17). Moreover, it can sometimes benefit from optimized implementation as well as from hardware acceleration.\n",

        "ANS: If we set the momentum hyperparameter too close to 1 (e.g., 0.99999) when using an SGD optimizer, then the algorithm will likely pick up a lot of speed, hopefully moving roughly toward the global minimum, but its momentum will carry it right past the minimum. Then it will slow down and come back, accelerate again, overshoot again, and so on. It may oscillate this way many times before converging, so overall it will take much longer to converge than with a smaller momentum value.\n",

        "ANS: Yes, dropout does slow down training, in general roughly by a factor of two. However, it has no impact on inference speed since it is only turned on during training. MC Dropout is exactly like dropout during training, but it is still active during inference, so each inference is slowed down slightly. More importantly, when using MC Dropout you generally want to run inference 10 times or more to get better predictions. This means that making predictions is slowed down by a factor of 10 or more.\n",
